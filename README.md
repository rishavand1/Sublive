# Sublive
Sublive is a lightweight command-line tool written in Go for quickly scanning and checking the liveness of subdomains for a given domain. It resolves subdomains, attempts HTTP/HTTPS connections, and reports status codes and IPs. It supports wordlists from files, stdin, or defaults, with options for recursion depth and concurrency.
